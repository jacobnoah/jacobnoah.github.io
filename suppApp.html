								<p>This application is one of my proudest in terms of real world use.
                                    The business owner of Vine Healthcare was mentioning a problem to some of the staff.
                                    I just happened to hear her say that for patients who lived very far away,
                                    they sometimes do not know how many pill bottles to get for the prescription from
                                    the doctor since they would schedule their appointments further out than usual. I decided
                                    to apply myself and worked in my free time to make an application that would track next appointment time,
                                    what the supplement is (from a dynamic list on a google spreadsheet), and the number of servings per day. The app will quickly
                                    tell you how many supplement bottles are needed in around 2 minutes compared with up to 40 when done the original way at the front desk.
                                    This project I created is still being used today.
                                </p>
